Mean_population = 100
SD_population = 15
Mean_samle = 108
Sample size = 36
Significance level assumed (alpha) = .05 (5%)

Null Hypothesis - Mean blood glucose level will be <= 100
Alternate hypothesis - Mean blood glucose level will > 100

z_alpha(.05) critical value = 1.645

z_score = (108 - 100) / (15/sqrt(36)) = 48/15 = 3.2

Since calculated z_score > critcal value z_alpha, we can reject Null hypothesis, hence there is raw cornstarch effect.
